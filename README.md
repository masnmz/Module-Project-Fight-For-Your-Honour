# Module-Project-Fight-For-Your-Honour
Fight for Your Honour is a text-based roleplaying game which is created for Programming Through Python module.

A treacherous scheme threatens the security of the kingdom in the world of “Fight for Your Honour”, and the player takes on the character of a valiant warrior who is desperate to uncover the truth. The mystery centres on the monarch's second-favourite knight, who is thought to be treacherous. 
The game is divided between numerous levels a castle and a town market, each of which has its own set of obstacles and enemies, except the town market.  To advance, the players must combat opponents, get strong armour and weaponry, gather proof of the conspiracy, and finally face the plot's leader. 
The players' objective is to reveal the disloyal knight and restore his honour. Players must effectively travel through the castle's 11 stories, kill increasingly tough foes, and gather crucial pieces of evidence that reveal the scheme to do this. When the player encounters the Betrayer Knight Leader on the eleventh floor and obtains the conclusive proof required to clear their identity, the win condition is satisfied. 
In total, the game has 12 rooms.  A Castle of 11 floors and a town market with health potions only.
